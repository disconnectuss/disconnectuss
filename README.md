### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm @disconnectuss or Fatma, an English teacher turned web developer. While teaching has always been my passion, I've recently discovered my love for coding and web development. I'm currently focused on mastering the React front-end framework, and I've been using and learning HTML, CSS, SCSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Redux, and React to build dynamic and engaging web applications.

As an extroverted and sociable person, I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy working with teams to create innovative solutions. I'm excited to apply my communication and problem-solving skills to the world of web development, and I'm constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow my skills.

In my free time, I love to stay active and explore new places. Whether it's hiking in the mountains or trying out a new restaurant in town, I'm always up for an adventure. Thanks for stopping by my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with you!
